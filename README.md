Coding test for interview #1
=======

This was a test I was required to complete for a Front End Developer job in Sydney around February 2014. The test was emailed to me and I was required to complete it, zip it up and email it back within 2 hours.

I passed the test and was asked in for an interview but actually accepted a different role I was offered so I never went.

The code in this repo is what I emailed back to the company, below are the instructions that came in the email.

###WEBCHAT

For this coding test, please build the attached JPG as a standalone page, using standards compliant HTML & CSS, JavaScript and submit your code as a zipped folder, using your own name as the filename. You may use any framework if you wish to.

You must email this back as a zip file within 2 hours.
 
####TEST INSTRUCTIONS

The User Interface team was required to build a simulation of a web chat so the client can have an idea of how it would look like in the portal.
 
The designer has put together a storyboard and your mission is to build the widget as fast as you can.
Remember it's a fake web chat and there is no connection to the back-end, just a prototype with hard-coded data.
 
1) The user is presented with a web chat widget with a call to action to start the chat.
